A fully functional **E-Commerce Shopping Cart** application built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. This project enables users to browse products, add them to the cart, view cart details, and manage their purchases effectively.

## Features

- Display a list of products dynamically.
- Add products to the shopping cart.
- Update item quantities directly in the cart.
- Remove individual items or clear the entire cart.
- Calculate and display the total price of items in the cart.
- Persistent cart state using localStorage.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-ecommerce-shoppingcart.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd javascript-ecommerce-shoppingcart
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing functionality like adding/removing items, updating quantities, and managing local storage.

## How It Works

1. **Product Display**:  
   Products are displayed dynamically on the webpage.

2. **Add to Cart**:  
   Users can add products to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.  

3. **Cart Management**:  
   - Update item quantities in the cart.  
   - Remove individual items or clear the cart.  

4. **Price Calculation**:  
   The total price of items in the cart is calculated automatically and displayed.  

5. **Persistent Storage**:  
   The cart state is saved in localStorage, ensuring it remains even after the browser is closed.
